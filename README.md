# Project Pitch:
The app provides users with a virtual plant that they can "plant" and take care of by watering daily. The plant grows through different stages (Seed → Sprout → Sapling → Tree) based on user interaction. If the user forgets to water the plant for too long, the growth may reset. This app encourages daily engagement and encourages a simple self-care activity.
# Front End:
The project will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple and interactive webpage. Users can:

Click a "Plant" button to start growing their virtual plant.
Click a "Water" button to progress the plant’s growth stage.
See the current growth stage visually represented on the screen with text or images.
# Back End:
The back end will use Flask (Python) to handle simple API requests for managing the plant’s growth logic. It will:

Serve endpoints to "plant," "water," and check the plant's status.
Handle the progression of growth stages based on daily watering.
Reset the plant to an earlier stage if it isn’t watered within a specific time frame.
